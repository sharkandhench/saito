<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a personal workspace for exploring topics in health economics, outcomes research, and the Japanese healthcare system.</p>

<p>It exists because some ideas need a place to live before they're ready for anything formal. Writing things down in a structured way — even roughly — makes the thinking better.</p>

<h2>What this is</h2>

<p>A collection of working notes, data explorations, and reference material. Nothing here is final or peer-reviewed. It's a workshop, not a gallery.</p>

<h2>Who</h2>

<p>An HEOR specialist based in Tokyo, working across Japanese and international pharmaceutical markets.</p>
